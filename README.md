## 📜 About

Taan (meaning "a musical phrase" in Hindustani classical music) is a lightweight, fast, and native desktop client for Spotify. This project is in its very early stages of development, aiming to provide a clean and minimal user experience for listening to music on Spotify.

Currently, Taan is a work-in-progress. Here are some of the features that are being worked on:

- [x] Spotify authentication
- [x] Playback of Spotify tracks
- [ ] Viewing playlists, albums, and artists
- [ ] A clean, minimal, and native user interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Rust**: The core language for the application.
- **Slint**: A modern Rust UI toolkit for building native applications.
- **librespot**: An open-source client library for Spotify.
- **rspotify**: A Rust wrapper for the Spotify Web API.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Make sure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed. You can get it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
